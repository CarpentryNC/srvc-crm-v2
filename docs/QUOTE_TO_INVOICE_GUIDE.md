# Quote to Invoice Conversion Feature

## Overview
The Quote to Invoice conversion feature allows users to seamlessly convert accepted quotes into invoices, automatically transferring all quote details including line items, customer information, and totals.

## How It Works

### 1. Quote Status Requirement
- Only quotes with status "accepted" will show the "Create Invoice" button
- The feature is designed to maintain business workflow integrity

### 2. Accessing the Feature
- Navigate to any accepted quote's detail page
- In the action bar at the top, you'll see a blue "Create Invoice" button
- Click this button to open the conversion modal

### 3. Conversion Process
The modal displays:
- **Quote Summary**: Shows quote number, customer, line items count, and total amount
- **Line Items Preview**: All quote line items that will be transferred to the invoice
- **Invoice Details Form**: Where you can customize:
  - Invoice title (defaults to quote title)
  - Description (optional)
  - Due date (defaults to 30 days from creation)

### 4. What Gets Transferred
- **Customer Information**: Automatically linked to the same customer
- **Line Items**: All quote line items with quantities, prices, and descriptions
- **Totals**: Subtotal, tax, and total amounts are preserved
- **Quote Reference**: Invoice maintains a reference to the original quote

### 5. After Conversion
- Success message confirms invoice creation

- Original quote remains unchanged and accessible
- Invoice starts in "draft" status for further editing if needed
